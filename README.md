# Diabetes_Prediction_Deep-Neural-Networks_Keras
Predicting probability of development of diabetes condition in patients, basis labeled data
The data set is small with 750 odd training examples, which have been further divided into train and test data in ratio 3:1
Considering only 600 examples to train with the model outputs an accuracy of 79.2%, ahead of Gradient boosting classifier and random forest classifier (at 78.2% accuarcy each).
Further, the model produces low Type II error, that is, not correctly identifying a case of diabetes.
